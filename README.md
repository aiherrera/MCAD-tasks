### Task 1
* Cleaning dataset out of a variety of intentional errors added. There is a file called `task1.ipynb` that contains all the commands used to clean up the dataset. There are comments over each of the commands about what all of them do. For reproducing any of the commands just uncomment the line you want to test.

* Regarding to the proposition step, there is a file called `json_example.json` and an utility inside the utilities folder that modifies the json structure and generates a file called `json_example_modified.json` as intended in the second proposition of improvement set in the document. For testing purposes, just run the command like this:

* `> python3 ./utilities/jsonStructureChanger.py`
